Do you know game called 2048? Well this is really the same concept, just with some enhancements here and there. Tutorials are boring. This is a trivial game and you will learn while playing. This text is here for people who want to care. Move to the play tab via bottom bar.

## Rules
The game is fairly simple. you can move blocks in 4 directions over the grid and they collide with each other. If 2 blocks of the same number collide, they join and create a new block with 2 times bigger number. For joining a pair of blocks and creating a new block with higher number you earn same number of points as is the value of the new block. So if you join 2 + 2 = 4 you get 4 points.
The amount of space on the grid is not infinite of course and soon or later you will face a scarsity of free cells on the grid and you may get totally stuck without being able to move at all. If that happens you can undo your last move, but you can only do this 3 times in 1 game!

## Controls
If you are on device with touchscreen you can swipe over any place on the play tab except the tab menu itself. This is propably the most convenient way how to play the game and of course on devices with keyboard you can use wsad or arrow keys to move the blocks.
For added accessibility for touchscreen devices without swipe support you can tap or click on parts of the play grid to move blocks in that direction. You can also press space to start a new game or press backspace to undo your last block move.
